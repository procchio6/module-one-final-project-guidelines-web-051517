# FareTrackrâ„¢

## Introduction

This is a simple, CLI application which allows users to log NYC yellow cab ride details such as fare and driver. User may view a history of their logged rides.

This product was created as our first project with Flatiron School and uses a subset of the NYC's active taxi drivers with valid medallions.

## Features

1. Users login by using and/or creating a username/password
2. Users options are given to either create a new ride record or view their ride history
3. If they are creating a new ride, they are prompted for the drivers's medallion number and fare amount.
4. If they wish to view their ride history, they are prompted for the number of recent rides they would like to view. The results will show their history sorted by newest to oldest rides.
5. Once completed, a user may logout of their session.
